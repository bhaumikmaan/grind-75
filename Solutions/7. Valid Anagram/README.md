# 7. Valid Anagram [(LINK)](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

> Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

Solution: 

* Anagram: A set of strings that can be made using the same characters
* Sort the two strings and check whether they are the same or not
* OR, make a counter, that stores the count of each character. If the 2 counters are same, they are anagram
