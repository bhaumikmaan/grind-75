# 17. Longest Palindrome [(LINK)](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/)

> Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.


Solution:

* Count the number of odd characters. Since the number of odd characters can not be used to make a pair in the palindrome
* However one odd character can be used to make the middle character of a palindrome string
